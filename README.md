Bushing test data analyzer - static stiffness, hysteresis and curve plot
This code has been created as a form of a "Hello World" during python study.
It's purpose is to analyze data from test rigs (i.e. MTS) provided in excel or txt form
Output of the analyze is a plot of the total travel and hysteresis and calualtion of the static stiffness and hysteresis. By default, stiffness is calculated in +/-0.5mm range.
